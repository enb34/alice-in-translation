            <h3 id="back"><span class="title">Alice</span> Translations in History </h3>
            <p>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland was written by Lewis Carroll (a pseudonym created by
                Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) and was originally published in 1865. Carroll published
                three other Alice-related works: Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found
                There (1871), Alice’s Adventure’s Under Ground (1886), and The Nursery ‘Alice’ (1890). </p>
            <p>The first Japanese translation of one of Carroll’s works was of Through the Looking
                Glass published in 1899. Since this initial translation, there have been 1,271
                editions of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and 321 editions of Through the Looking
                Glass translated into Japanese over the course of 119 years (it should be noted that
                the only other language with translations in the thousands is Spanish with 1,223
                editions; the third most popular language, German, has less than half of this)
                (Lindseth 741). Titles often differ across translations, but the most commonly used
                title is Fushigi no Kuni no Arisu (「不思議の国のアリス」). </p>
            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>The translation of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland used for this project is titled
                Arisu wa Fushigi no Kuni de (「アリスはふしぎの国で」) and was translated by Yu Okubo (大久保ゆう訳)
                in 2014. There are several reasons why this edition was chosen. This edition, unlike
                many other translations, is out of copyright. One of the goals of this project is to
                allow the reader to view both the Japanese and English texts side-by-side, to truly
                be able to compare the original with its translation. The recent date of publication
                for this translation also made it appealing, as the language and referenced used
                would likely be more current, and any unknown features of the text would be easier
                to look up. Even the title of this work made it appealing; the deviation of the
                title from the accepted standard title used in the Japanese translation community
                indicated that there might be a larger amount of interesting linguistical features
                embedded within the text. </p>
            <p> The texts used in this project can be found on the text pages, as well as on their
                respective original sources. The edition of the Japanese text can be found at <a

        <div class="description">
            <h3>Linguistic Methods</h3>
            <p>Two kinds of words were looked for within the texts; nonsense words and incorrect word usage. Nonsense words (“ns”) are words that were coined by Carroll or Okubo. Incorrect word usage (“iu”) was used as an umbrella term for words that are accepted by the dictionary, but that were used in the improper context. 
            </p>
            <p>The translation of play on words (“pow”) was also looked for when analyzing the texts. The types of word play focused on were idioms and syntactic play, lexical play, and phonetic and phonemic play. Each kind of word play occurs under the same tag. Word play that was based on structure or typography were not marked; this kind of word play was not as commo. The English and this edition of the Japanese are also very similar in structure, with the same number of paragraphs per chapter and same basic structure to poems and songs.</p>
            <p>Within the text, play on words often occurred in a specific format; a character would make a statement that would be misinterpreted by another character, who would respond, creating a sense of verbal irony for the reader. These exchanges would often occur over multiple paragraphs, which could make tagging while maintaining well-formedness difficult. For ease of tagging play on words within the structure of the text, only the second part of the play on words phrase would be tagged. For example:</p>
            <!--Insert blockquote or image with English and Japanese marked up pow here-->
            <p>Onomatopoeia (“onomatopoeia”) was added later to the project. Japanese uses a larger quantity of onomatopoeia than English does, but onomatopoeia is still present within the English text.</p>
            <p>Within the original XML files, distinctions were made between words and phrases when marking up the text; however, these distinctions have not been included in the XHTML. Both &lt;word&gt; and &lt;phrase&gt; tags contained an attribute that was allowed the same specifications. Because of this, and because the differences between “words” and “phrases” were determined to be insignificant for this project, the XHTML includes only the attribute specifications in a &lt;span&gt; without distinguishing whether the text is a word or a phrase. </p>
            <p>Not all attribute specifications were included in the final markup on this site; originally the texts were also marked up for uncommon word usage (“uc”) and Japanese text that ‘matched’ a marked phrase in the English, but that contained no device itself (“match”). Uncommon usage was originally placed on the English words and phrases that had were considered out-of-date, but they were later left out for several reasons. The Japanese translation of <span class="title">Alice </span> used in this project was published in 2014, and likely contains modern Japanese in most cases. The other reason lies in the proficiency of Japanese of the researchers; as neither Dana nor Emily are native Japanese speakers, it would have been difficult to know for certain which Japanese was out-of-date. For this reason, the Japanese text contains no “uc” tags. Match, however, was left out of the HTML when it was decided that the two texts did not to mirror each other in their entirety when rendered on the site. </p>
